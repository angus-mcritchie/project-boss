# Project Boss
Quickly switch between projects.

No setup required, but you can configure how it scans for, and opens projects in the settings.

## Features
* Quickly switch between projects using command palate or side panel.
* Open in new or current window.
* Automatically updates project list based on your settings.
* Supports opening in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distros.

## Usage

## How it works
By default, it scans your `~/projects` folder for files commonly included in development projects, such as `.git`, `package.json`, and supports nesting for better organization, take the below structure, for example.

`~/projects`
* `personal`
  * `proxy-server`
  * `website`
* `acme-mechanical`
  * `inventory`
  * `sales`
* `acme-financial`
  * `tax-returns`
  * `payroll`


> Tip: You can configure how it scans for projects in the settings.
